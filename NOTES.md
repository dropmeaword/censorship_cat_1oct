How I came to all this?
- my interest in (circumventing) online censorship
- the political situation made it obvious that any attempt at activity online will be met with strong censorship
- how things played out on the 1st of October

When I studied the website I realized that this was not your average website. This was written by someone who knew what they were doing.
As an anti-censorship activist the typical advice you would give to an organization that wants to collect or publish sensitive information is to do it as a Tor Hidden Service if done well this can offer certain guarantees.

But this website needed to be in the open Internet.

Trying to address the question: How do you build a Universal Digital Referendum when you know that a State power is behind you and that they will retaliate with all they have?

On 24 NOV 2016 ex-senator Santi Vidal said: "Right now, the Catalonian government has all your your personal data from the Tax system. Is this legal? Well, no it isn't. Data Protection Laws applicable in the whole of the Spanish territory technically prevent us from doing this. But we are not stupid."

On January 2017, ERC, his party asked him to step down.

This was the official website of the Referendum made for the Catalan Governement. It doesn’t work since Guardia Civil (Spanish half civilian half militarized police) seized the hosting provided by CDMON (hosting) and Fundació puntCAT (domain name manager).

Censorship has targeted official websites of Generalitat, the Catalan Governement. Non-official replicas published by private individuals are still active. Websites hosted in Spain or domain names managed by organizations in Spain have been disabled physically.

The Spanish police seems not to be able to censor websites hosted abroad or with domain names managed by organizations abroad.

So in light of this, how do you put all that data online?
